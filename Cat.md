_A **cat** is a small, furry, domesticated animal known for its agility, independence, and playful nature. Cats are often kept as pets for their companionship and low-maintenance care. They have sharp claws and excellent night vision, making them natural hunters. With a unique mix of curiosity and aloofness, cats are both affectionate and self-sufficient, forming close bonds with their owners while also enjoying their own space._
